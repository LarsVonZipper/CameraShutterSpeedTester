# Camera Shutter Speed Tester
An Arduino project to report on the speed of a camera's shutter.

Look, lets cut straight to the chase... i have no Arduino coding skills whatsoever. Period.
All this is, is somewhere for me to store the 'code' that i wrote that gives me a very rudimentary camera shutter speed tester. It measures shutter speeds of less than a second, displaying both the shutter action duration (in seconds) and the approximate shutter speed (i.e. 1/x)

You are free to do what you like with it. (e.g. laugh very loudly at it etc. etc.)
